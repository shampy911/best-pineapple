1.  **IELTS**

2.  **PTE**

Our aim is to help our students achieve success in the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and Pearson Test English (PTE)

Keeping this in mind, our trainers cater to the students’ needs by designing the curriculum and schedule in a way that suits the student’s individual requirements. The trainer first evaluates the students’ strengths and weaknesses, and then sketches an individualized study plan.

We employ various productive strategies of coaching like Efficient Time Management, Mock Tests, Problem Solving and Strategy Sessions to give our students the best training they need.

Our strategy to make you successful:

*   Classroom training

*   Online training

*   Mock test on regular basis

*   Expert certified trainers
